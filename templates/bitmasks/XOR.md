# XOR

Bitwise XOR operation is commutative and associative. That means:

- aXORbXORb=a
- aXORb=bXORa

Hence, the order of applying XOR operations doesn't matter.

XORing a number with itself (aXORa) results in 000.

Therefore, performing the XOR operation twice on the same number yields the original number.
