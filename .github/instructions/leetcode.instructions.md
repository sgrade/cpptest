# Instructions for formatting files in the `leetcode` directory

- Format the solution code according to the Google C++ Style Guide.
- Make sure that curly brackets are used in all control structures.

Exceptions:
- Do not use the std:: prefix for standard library components. Use specific using std::component; declarations for each required component instead of using namespace std;
- Do not capitalize the first letter of the function name in the main function to be compliant with LeetCode's requirements.
