# format-leetcode

Review the code and apply the Google C++ Style Guide with the following exceptions:
- Use `using namespace std;` instead of `std::` prefixes.
- Do NOT change the name and the signature of the classes and functions given in the LeetCode problem statement.

Additional requirements:
- Add necessary `#include` directives (e.g., `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, `<unordered_set>`, etc.) to eliminate linter errors, even though LeetCode itself provides these automatically.
